(UNDER CONSTRUCTION DON'T READ YET)
I took some linguistic courses in my first year. Back then I had big dreams. I imagined travelling to Japan and teaching English to kindergardeners in that most holy land of anime. Or maybe I would travel to some distant corner of Africa, translating the Bible into some obscure, unwritten tribal language, spreading the gospel of the Lord. Well, wherever I would go, it would be better than here, better than staying in boring old Ottawa my whole life! I was going to see something new! 

Unfortunately these dreams soon died as I realized that to follow them I would actually have to TALK to people. At that point in my life, I was not ready for such things. I didn't take any more courses in second year.

But I don't regret my brief foray into the linguistical. If I hadn't had those dreams, no matter how they turned out, I never would have taken that course on Applied Linguistics. I still think about the things that I learned there, even to this day. 

The professor was especially fond of a certain quote from Bakhtin - "No one breaks the eternal silence of the universe." It means, she explained, that there is nothing that has not already been said. No one's utterance is so utterly unique that it breaks the silence of the universe; instead we simply repeat and repeat what has already been said. This is not a meaning I would have guessed from an initial reading of the phrase, but, I suppose, that is why she has a degree in linguistics and I don't. 

Several years have passed since that time. I did not end up transferring into linguistics as I had once thought I might do - I ended up transferring to computer science instead. My memory of some of the concepts I learned back then begins to grow fuzzy. Yet every now and then I find myself still thinking about this idea: "No one breaks the eternal silence of the universe." 

I like the phrase because it has significance to me. There is a story attached to it, as I have just related to you. And moreover, it seems to me that it perfectly demonstrates all the principles I learned in that course - the first being the enormous capacity of human social groups to create a type of language that excludes. "No one breaks the eternal silence of the universe." It means something special in our class. If you hadn't been there with us, you might now understand. How exactly does this phrase mean "what has said has always been said?" All it means (from an initial, simplistic reading) is that nobody is talking! And nobody has ever talked! The world is silent! Which we know isn't true. But in the context of our class it took on a whole other meaning. It became a catchphrase, a rallying cry. We were going to be tested on it, and we had to comply to the teacher's interpretation if we wanted to pass. So now I am burdened with an interpretation of this phrase which no one else understands, it is meaningful to me but hardly to anyone else. 

But now I am sharing it with you, because the more I think about it, the more I suspect that Bakthin was right.  

No one breaks the eternal silence of the universe! How very true that is! It has taken on mystical qualities in my mind! 

In the beginning, there was nothing. 
In the beginning, there was silence.

The earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And with God, was the Word. The Word was in the beginning with God. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In that Word is all things that has ever been spoken:  without him there is nothing has been spoken. All that has been spoken and will be spoken is contained within that Word. 

So there, the phrase contains a Biblical truth. As it was in the beginning, is now and will be forever. For me that makes it believable - maybe others will have trouble believing that. You will have to examine the idea on your own. You will have to reach your own conclusions.

In the book of Ecclesiastes, Solomon tells us: "What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun. Is there anything of which one can say, “Look! This is something new”? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time."

Yet originality is something highly valued in our culture. We are told from childhood that we are somebody special. Nobody is quite like us. We are expected to go on and accomplish something that nobody has ever accomplished ever before. We celebrate the accomplishments of great men, we immortalize the tales of people with unusual genius. 

There was a game I used to play as a kid, one of those clapping games so popular among little girls. We sat in a circle and clapped our hands, saying:
Concentration(clap clap clap)64(clap clap clap)
No repeats(clap clap clap)
or hesitation!(clap clap clap)
I'll start!(We would all shout this. The loudest one was recognized to have the right to begin)(clap clap clap)
with <category>.

Then we would go around in a circle, each one naming something that was within that category. When it was your turn you were expected to say something right away. Otherwise you were out! And it had to be original - otherwise, you were out! 

I used to play that game quite a lot. It inspired within me a quest for novelty. I would never reread a book once I had finished it. No repeats, or hesitation! I always had to go on to something new!  

The thing was though, I wasn't a genius. I wasn't some kind of natural born savant. It's not that I was stupid - in fact, generally speaking I got good grades without even trying. But compared to someone like Carl Gauss who added all the numbers up to 100 when he was eight years old, my modest B+ in mathematics didn't seem to be worth that much. 



I used to watch this anime called "Haikyuu!!" It's really great! It's about volleyball. One of the episodes is called "Oikawa Tooru is not a genius." This may seem a bit demeaning to Oikawa. Actually, Oikawa is set up as a frighteningly talented individual - the "Grand King" of Aoba Josai, a vicious server, a clever strategist and an amazing setter who brings out the best of his team. Then what does that mean, "he's not a genius"?! 

Well, it's just that, especially compared to the setter on the main character's team, Oikawa is not particularly talented. Or that is, his talent does not come from some sort of natural innate ability.
