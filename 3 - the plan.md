It seems that I have had less time than I thought to work on this course. So I am behind. 

Well, what does it matter? It's no skin off my back. But I would like to start thinking about these things a little more and perhaps make something of my own. 

Although I have not had much luck with photogrametry, I did have a bit of a plan. I am not sure on all the details of what we are supposed to do because I have not been to any lectures, but that's alright, because it means I can do whatever I want, right? 

In any case, I will write down what I would like to do now, so that someday (hopefully soon) I will perhaps get around to doing it. 

So we are supposed to do something related to a building or object in our area. 

Well, what I would like to do is something related to my church. This is mostly ease of convenience, since it is close by to my house and I am there quite often. Christ Risen Lutheran Church Kanata. A place of historical significance? It's a more recent church, compared to St. Luke or St. Paul's downtown. But that doesn't mean that it has no history, or that it won't be history in the future, either. I will discuss it more in another post.

So I want to do something about this church. It would be cool to do a model of the whole thing, but I don't think I'd be able to do that with the equipment that I have. 

So what I was thinking was that I could do models of different objects throughout the church. 

Maybe I could do the communion cup, the baptismal font, I don't know, maybe some of those old tables upstairs with all the graffiti. The altar? 

That would be the first module. 

For the second, I was thinking I could perhaps I can tie sounds to the objects, evocative of purpose of the object. Like hymns; "Child of God I gladly say it" with the baptismal font, haha who knows. I would record the congregation singing relevant hymns and remix them with the model, somehow. Perhaps I can record other sounds as well. My brother talking with his friend up in the windowless room as they always do, the chatter of people in the parish hall as they drink coffee after church. The point is to tie objects/locations with the sound of those locations. And in the case of the hymns it not only points to the actual sounds of the experience, but to symbolic space as well, the cup as not just a cup but as a sacrament, that we participate in the holy body of Christ. I'm not exactly sure how this would look, but I would like to do something like that.

So that is my vague idea for the first two modules, although they should have already been done by now. I was thinking if I couldn't do a a proper 3d module maybe I'll just take pictures. Would be easier. But we'll see. If with photos I could even make it a simple twine game where you walk around the church and listen to the different songs. Hmm. 

I was also going to make a minecraft model of the church just because I think that's super cool. I even got minecraft for the WiiU from the library and I started it last night. I will report more on that later. 

So that is my vague plan, probably too vague. I will continue meandering down through this path and perhaps someday I will have something to show for it.
