Scrolling down the pages annotated with hypothesis, I am suddenly reminded of the days when I would watch my brother play Super Mario Maker. As he travelled across the screen, he would encounter the messages left behind by other players, hanging white and ghost-like over the screen. The game was haunted by messages from people no longer present, but whose presence, nevertheless, made itself known. 

At a crossroads, someone would note: "Don't go this way!" or "It's over here!"

High above the screen would float a few dozen comments of "Highest!" 

My brother made a level where you rode a platform for hours. "When will it end?!" the comments lamented.

Unlike other Nintendo games that incorporated Miiverse, Nintendo's social networking system, Super Mario Maker was unique in that tied user comments to a specific place. Their additions became part of the environment, part of the landscape of the game. They were a reminder of the people before us, a legacy for the people yet to come. Our experience influenced others experience, and it all became part of the game. Voices merged and overlapped, bouncing and interacting off each other. 

Today however, if you play Super Mario Maker, there will be no more comments. This feature no longer exists. Miiverse is dead. RIP Miiverse! Even now when I think about its passing I am filled with a deep sense of loss. Maybe it's stupid, but I loved that silly place. What will Super Mario Maker be, I wonder, without the comments? No doubt a dark and barren place.  

There is something wonderful about commentary. I am not mad when I open a book and see that someone has written in it. Instead it makes me excited! I love to read what others have written. It makes me feel less alone, to know that someone else has read the same thing as me, that someone has interacted with the same passage as me, that someone has been moved by the same work of art as me. I become part of a larger conversation. I look at an underlined passage and wonder what it was about that particular line which resonated so much with that person. What did it mean to them? And then, what does it mean to me? 

When I see notes scrawled in a library book I feel sometimes as if I am viewing a ghost. Who wrote this message? Where are they know? Are they alive or are they dead? I will probably never know. I will never meet them. To me they might as well be dead. But their message is their remnant. It takes root in my mind and lingers. It testifies to their existence.

In Super Mario Maker the levels were covered with the ghosts of the past. Literally so - because when you died you could see the little red Xs where those who had died before you. But it was also a living thing. The comments were ghosts from a player before you - yet you could interact with them! You could "Yeah!" them (the Miiverse equivalent of "Like") and leave behind your own message on the comment, which others in turn could interact with. Well, that's nothing astounding. This is the way the internet works these days.  

Of course, now that Miiverse is gone, the Super Mario Maker community really is nothing but a ghost in my memory. RIP Miiverse! I'll never forget you. You will be in my heart forever! 

I too, am like a ghost. I am not officially registered in the course. I cannot come to class, I have no existence. I am disembodied. I do not know the others and they do not know me. We exist together only within the text. 

Text itself can be a body. That's why we call enough of it a "corpus", a body. It is also like a corpse. Words are like leaves that have fallen from a tree - they can be beautiful, but they are dead. Once they are spoken they no longer exist in that same way in the person that spoke them, because words inside a person are always transforming. Words, once written, are inert and dead. 

But they are also alive. We continuously build upon them, ghost upon ghost upon ghost (words from a musical I once saw). This is what comments do. This is why I find annotations beautiful. As long as we keep commenting, as long as  we keep turning other people's ideas around in our heads, interacting and creating with ideas, we are building something new. 

Or something like that, anyways. 

Look I just wanted to talk about Miiverse, okay? I'm really bummed out that it's gone. (T.T)
