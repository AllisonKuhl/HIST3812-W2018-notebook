- the imprints of corpses....
- weird.

- i dunno there's just something really creepy about it
- like walking on a graveyard... :I
- like, let the dead stay dead, you know?
- i mean it's like i'm about to die and somebody takes a picture of my horrified face, like excuse me, can you just let me die here? This isn't exactly an experience I want to be remembered for.
- maybe that's just me though

- copies that mantain an aura
- well, because it's a human being... or the imprint of one. 

- the filling up of the void, a restoring of it's original form?
- the casts are spoilable, they shrink, contain imperfections.. they are not the same as a body, a whole new materiel. like a... cyborg 

virtual skeuomorphs

-what is a skeuomorph anyhow??!! 
- "A skeuomorph is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues from structures that are inherent to the original. Examples include pottery embellished with imitation rivets reminiscent of similar pots made of metal and a software calendar that imitates the appearance of binding on a paper desk calendar"
- like ummmm pockets on woman's pants or something i dunno haha. purely decorative.

- virtual models cannot decay in the sense of the casts
- but i think software can decay in a sense
- why else there are all these jobs to replace dying legacy systems?
- software leaks and stuff... probably not at all like I'm picturing haha. (like that comedy sketch... you stick your finger in a leak while another one opens)

orthothetic
- "exact" form of recording
-how exact is it, really?

"Whereas in the ‘old’ physical world
the processes of materialization and dematerialization
were paramount, in the digital universe
born-digital instantiations enable more
promiscuous translations, and substitutions,
to start colonizing adjacent, previously
untrammelled, spaces in Lucas’ flat ontology. At the same time, formerly irreversible
changes are now becoming unstable and
indeed reversible as the virtual and material
worlds begin to seep, or bleed, into one
another."

-what kind of pretentious academese is this haha? 
- such language
- good stuff good stuff
