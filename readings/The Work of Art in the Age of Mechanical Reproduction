mechanical reproductions do have a sort of aura though... for example a movie that came out in such a such a time, is a product of that time and culture. Us watching Star Wars now, is different from when they watched Star Wars then... but it is part of the same legacy.
Or take the fidget spinner - it is significant to us now, but in a few years it will be a relic. A youtube video created now that has a fidget spinner, we understand it, we will laugh. But in a few years they will look back at it and there will be this huge distance, they will observe, but not understand.


aura as a distance


"For the first time in the process of pictorial reproduction, photography freed the hand of the most important artistic functions which henceforth devolved only upon the eye looking into a lens."

"eye looking into a lens"
- the artist becomes passive
- the artist consumes just as much as the consumer

is not the creation of a work of art just as liquidifying as a reproduction of a work of art?
A painting of a landscape is a flattening of the landscape - a sculpture of a women is still not a real woman. 
but not all art attempts to represent... (well, it usually represents something, just not always real physical objects)

- the rise of individualism in art
It is no longer about the aura of the art itself - the aura becomes individualized, unique to each person, it becomes a part of OUR narrative, WE embed it with meaning
Thus when I see such and such a painting it will remind me of that time in class when we were talking about it, or whatever

- art as ritual

- reproducibility reduces the idea of the "authentic" - which is the authentic photograph?! They all look the same!

- does this really reverse the function of art? was art really just ritual in the first place?
- even in the middle ages? There were like a gazillion sculptures of the virgin mary. But I guess they were all different
- but which one is the more authentic one? 
- you can't really say... they all represent the same thing!
- however they were tied to a specific place i guess?

- what is ritual anyhow

- an art as something not even that important 
- in fact it is only -symbolic of something greater.
- the virgin mary isn't special IN ITSELF
- but that it represents the virgin mary
- it has a symbolic purpose, but it could be literally any portrait of the virgin mary and it could serve practically the same purpose in many cases (though not all I suppose... some are special because they are so unique or something?)
- like when something is being used for a cult... it is the use that is important, not the object...? I mean they could use anything just the same way, but this particular one is infused with some sort of special....aura if you will?
- well maybe i can't understand it because i don't live in that kind of ritualistic world


cult as the basis of art - true or not true? What about... things like clothing? They can be art. Utilitarian objects? Like a decorated lamp or sword or whatever. are they cultish? Or just things that we use? What about things just made for the aesthetic? 

art to be displayed vs. art which is used
things that we use that also happen to be beautiful
vs. things that are beautiful, meant to only be observed
the later becomes simply a representation...an attempt to capture some sort of platonic Beauty, perhaps.

movie actors as lacking corporeality


a play you can tell its a play - that it's scened.
with movies its much more difficult to tell

reality free of all equipment

film exposes the ordinary
- when we view the world we don't alway see
- film has no choice but to see

- film as distraction, no time to contemplate
- "my thoughts have been replaced by moving images" true that
- whereas with paintings its like that scene from Ferris Bueller... absorbed by the painting haha
"He enters into this work of an the way legend tells
of the Chinese painter when he viewed his finished painting." - Like in Blue's clues! (lol)


- ah I see... ritualistic properties. A movie, watched every year at a specific time, can become ritualistic. Does it then obtain an aura? To those who participate, perhaps
