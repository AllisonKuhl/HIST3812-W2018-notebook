- like my brothers' "high quality rips" haha XD
- that 'silvagunna' character
- I never understood his obessesion with this channel haha

- but then again I'll watch that "Cooking by the Book" mashup over and over again
- so perhaps I just have a poor taste in music.

Phaedrus on Writing
- cannot protect itself, it is silent
- dead

phonographic reproduction as a duplication "to record"
- audio documentation

- scandal in the grammy's because recording artists did not actually preform the music in their record

- sound as something to preserve after death
- done without originators consent

- but also something that is known, because it is always the same
- not the sponteanity of life music
- but then all modern pop songs are dependant on repitition and "standerdization" 

- "paternity" in copy right laws
- to protect the poor orphaned sound that cannot protect itself
- as opposed to K.K. Slider's philosophy haha 
"my music wants to be free!"
- k.k. slider, you da man!

- mashups take the basic repeatablity and interchangibility of modern music ("it all sounsd the same!" "so derivative!") and does exactly that with it. interchange it. 

- modern pop songs do not necessarily have a single author anyways
so what is a mashup doing differently?
-authorship as a construct with its own history assumption and political interests
