there are different types of narrative nodes

- each type of object has a different way of a story 
a book for example, priviledges a written narrative without gaps (ie generally you read it left to right) whereas a video game allows a less linear play through (depends on game though)

many structures are mimetic and just copy ones we are familiar with (ex. linear story-telling of a movie)

but we need to think BEYOND that, how can we use the affordances and structure of the digital world to create new ways of story-telling?

1. linear (your typical kind of museum

2. active (different modules, browse at your own leisure kind of thing)

- personally I find these things so stressful... Like, which one do I choose? Where do I go first?! What if I choose the wrong one? I didn't come here to make CHOICES?!

- but how can we make this easier?

- what if it is something you are specifically trying to find out?
- like you inhabit a role and go on a scavenger hunt for information?
- like, the choice only comes at the end

- at the beginning it's like "You are Canute. You want to take over England. What do you do first?" and it gives you a bunch of information. 

- then at the end you choose several options and see what happens or something??
- would be embarassing to get wrong though

- just an idea anyhow.

In any case these two forms of narrative are largely mimetic

##What can digitally native narrative structures offer?


---active multilinear----

- your decisions affect how story unfolds
- nodes become decision branching tree
- ah my good friend the binary tree

- a twine game 
- multiple outcomes, nodes, etc.
- user choices that matter 
- can only exist in the digital sphere
- FOR NOW anyways (???!!!?)
- history becomes a DISCUSSION and not a LECTURE
- personalized information

--- active emergent narrative ---

- @_@  ???
- created i think, by the system and actor each contributing, without either the result would not be the same.
- like uuuhhh Mario Maker!

- user generated content interacting with system databases and whatever
- "multivocality"
- Clifford's Tower: Voices - what is it like people leaving notes on the wall of a museum? "tell us about your experience!"
- but I guess interpolates it with historians thoughts and stuff too.

- how can we think about the past in different ways?
- how can we use different narrative structures to help us think about the past in new ways?

- a shift from telling one story to multiple stories
