I am behind! What can I say? The past few weeks have been busy, life gets in the way, etc etc... And I procrastinated a bit too. 

But yesterday I thought to myself "I better start this, or else I never will" so after work even though I was tired I forced myself to give it a try.

I thought that I'd better start small. What could I use? Eventually I settled on an Amiibo. There was something weirdly poetic about it, I thought. An Amiibo is the physical representation of something that originally was digital - in this case the little blue squidkid from Splatoon. Wouldn't it be funny to take that and make it digital again? It's like when you google translate something from English into five different languages then back to English again. Not to mention that the entire point of an Amiibo is to translate something physical back into the digital realm... Anyways...

So I got out my little blue inkling boy amiibo. I don't have a phone, so I decided to try the camera + 3DF Zephyr option. I got the photos, loaded it up into 3DF Zephyr and...!

Well, I don't know if I did a bad job taking photos or the thing was too complex or my computer just isn't good enough, but it didn't work. The modeling kept failing! 

At least I tried. 

So what are my options now? Perhaps I will try again tonight with a simpler object. I will try again somewhere with better lighting. I will try again with 3DF Zephyr tonight, and if it still doesn't work then I will have to find some time to go into the Underhill research room and try using that Agisoft software. When do I have time to do that? Who knows... Maybe Friday evening.
